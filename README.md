1. Select traits
2. Get instruments for traits
3. Extract SNPs from outcomes
4. Harmonise data
5. Perform MR
6. Upload to neo4j

7. Add new traits
    - add to existing traits
    - get instruments and find unique instruments
    - extract all outcome SNPs for new trait, and new instruments from other traits
    - harmonise data
    - perform MR
    - upload to neo4j




## 

need two files

- node information
- mr estimates
- heterogeneity stats
-
