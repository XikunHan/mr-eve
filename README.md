1. Select traits
2. Get instruments for traits
3. Extract SNPs from outcomes
4. Harmonise data
5. Perform MR
6. Upload to neo4j

7. Add new traits
    - add to existing traits
    - get instruments and find unique instruments
    - extract all outcome SNPs for new trait, and new instruments from other traits
    - harmonise data
    - perform MR
    - upload to neo4j




## 

need two files

- node information
- mr estimates
- heterogeneity stats

the paper

the causal map of the human phenome: a first draft

- intro
    - methods and data enable faster causal inference
    - hypothesis driven analysis should use all methods to scrutinise
    - we can precalculate these estimates but automation requires a number of things still
        - instrument selection using steiger test
        - method selection using linear discriminant analysis
    - here we introduce a comprehensive analysis of 150 traits, introducing two ways for automating instrument selection and method selection

- results
    - created graph
    - steiger method simulations
    - method selection simulations
